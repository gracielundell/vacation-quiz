#Vacation Destination Quiz
JavaScript and jQuery Exercise for Epicodus, 01.15.2016

###By Gracie Lundell

##Description
This is my week two code review for Epicodus's Introduction to Programming class. The assignment was to build a site where a user could go, answer a few questions about themselves, and find out what their ideal vacation destination would be based on those answers. My quiz bases its results off six questions, and there are four destinations the user could get as a result. The logic was written using JavaScript and its library jQuery. The dropdown menus containing the questions were built using HTML. The site was styled using CSS and Bootstrap.

##Setup
The project is hosted [here]() on GitHub pages.
